# Motivations

- **Helping others**: Few things bring me greater joy than helping someone learn or solve a problem.
- **Making a difference**: I thrive when I see how my work is meaningful and contributes to the Bigger Picture.
- **Learning and growing**: I do well when I have clear, measurable goals and regularly make progress towards them. I am very reflective and appreciate frequent feedback on my progress.
- **Structure**: setting clear expectations and establishing process helps me stay organized and break problems down. I am adept at building structure for myself, but I do my best work when my team agrees to some form of structure as well.
- **Getting stuff done**: I’m happiest when I’m regularly shipping alongside a solid team.
- **Having fun**: Humor and playfulness help me establish trust with my teammates and stay motivated to do my best work.
- **Equality**: I want to make this industry a better place, particularly for URMs.

- I don’t have email on my phone and disable all notifications outside of working hours.
