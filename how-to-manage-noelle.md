# Motivations

- **Helping others**: Few things bring me greater joy than helping someone learn or solve a problem.
- **Making a difference**: I thrive when I see how my work is meaningful and contributes to the Bigger Picture.
- **Learning and growing**: I do well when I have clear, measurable goals and regularly make progress towards them. I am very reflective and appreciate frequent feedback on my progress.
- **Structure**: setting clear expectations and establishing process helps me stay organized and break problems down. I am adept at building structure for myself, but I do my best work when my team agrees to some form of structure as well.
- **Getting stuff done**: I’m happiest when I’m regularly shipping alongside a solid team.
- **Having fun**: Humor and playfulness help me establish trust with my teammates and stay motivated to do my best work.
- **Equality**: I want to make this industry a better place, particularly for URMs.

# Needs

## From Manager

- Help setting measurable goals and ensuring I have opportunities to meet them
- Clear, actionable, and regular feedback so I can improve. What should I start/stop/continue doing?
- Ensuring I’m prioritizing the right things so I can meet my goals
- Ensuring my contributions (technical and otherwise!) are valued and highlighted

## From Teammates

- Clear, actionable, and regular feedback so I can improve
- Honest code review so I can improve as an engineer and contribute meaningfully
- Empathetic communication

# Schedule

- I concentrate best in the morning. This is when I prefer to do most of my coding work. I tend to prefer meetings and collaborative work in the afternoons.
- I have a home office but like to work with others in person (or over video conference) when possible.
- I don’t have email on my phone and disable all notifications outside of working hours, but I can change that if needed.

# Goals

## Near term

    * Ramp up on team technologies so I can work autonomously ~70% of the time
    * Ship small, frequent, meaningful contributions
    * Understand the context of my work — why it’s important, who the users are, etc.
    * Familiarize myself with our development process
    * Network with other engineers and teams

## Long term

    * Be able to demo our team's work to stakeholders
    * Develop enough product & codebase expertise so others come to me for questions
    * Own particular features or projects
    * Partner with design to influence design decisions
    * Identify myself as a UX engineering leader & design partner
    * Mentor others
    * Continue speaking about UI and other topics at internal & externals conferences, meetups etc.
